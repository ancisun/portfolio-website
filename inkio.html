      <h3>Introducing Ink.io</h3>
      <p>Context: Ink.io is the first project I completed during the UX Immersion course at CareerFoundry. A project brief was provided, but students were given the flexibility to customize their projects. I opted to create a tattoo app to explore
        how technology has impacted the tattoo industry and its users.</p>
      <p>Problem: Users need a central source to find information pertinent to tattoos, such as artists, events, and studios, while being welcomed into a supportive and inclusive community.</p>
      <p>Solution: A mobile app that centralizes tattoo-related information, in addition to allowing users to join a welcoming and inclusive community.</p>
      <p>My role: UX Designer/Researcher</p>
      <p>Client: CareerFoundry</p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <h4>Competitive Analysis & User Research</h4>
      <p>To develop a better understanding of other competitor tattoo apps, I conducted analyses to make better-informed decisions on product strategy and identify underserved opportunities in the market.</p>

      <img src="img/ink.io/ink.io_swotprofile(inkhunter).png" alt="InkHunter Competitive Analysis">
      <p>I conducted research on two main competitors, InkHunter and Tattoodo. Below are key findings.</p>
      <p> Once I had a better understanding of tattoo competitors, I focused my research on identifying the needs of potential users. I interviewed 6 people from different demographics to understand their needs from a tattoo app.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
      <h4>User personas, user journeys, user flows</h4>
      <p> Based on the earlier user interviews, I created three personas to represent the user group. Natasha represents the first-time tattoo enthusiast, Susan represents the regular customer, and Michael represents the careful customer who puts a
        lot of deliberation into each tattoo.</p>
      <p> Now that I have my personas, I can map out the user's needs and goals. This helped me define and visualize the user's needs in order to move forward with the app's navigation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Lo-fi prototypes</h3>
      <p>I started the design process by mapping out the overall information architecture of the app. I wanted to explore in more depth the booking consultation user flow.</p>
      <p> After mapping out the app's hierarchy and layout, I started creating mid-fidelity prototypes in Balsamiq. The prototypes below demonstrate the signup/onboarding process, as well as the booking request process. I then ran a quick round of
        user testing to test if users were able to understand the process.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <h4>Perform usability testing & identify improvements</h4>
      <p>Usability testing was very helpful in identifying aspects of the process that were confusing. Below are results from the testing, organized via affinity mapping into different categories.</p>
      <p>Post affinity mapping, I identified several severe errors to take into consideration for the final design.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Final Design</h3>
      <p>After a few rounds of usability testing and several iterations, a final design was produced using Adobe XD. I revamped the visual design of the entire app by incorporating Google's material design icons consistently throughout the app, as
        well as overhauling the previous color palette.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot about the principles of good design when I was making my final iterations. The color palette I initially used received a lot of confusion during the peer feedback session. In the end, I decided on several shades of blue.
        During the competitive analysis stage, I noted that tattoo apps tend to favor dark and heavy colors. This was a factor in my decision to add lighter hues to lighten a process wrought with heavy emotions. I wanted to put my users at ease
        during this processs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>This was my first experience designing an app utilizing UX methodology. Here are some key takeaways:
        <ol>
          <li>User research is incredibly important, but more important is the way questions are asked. I had to train myself to stop asking leading questions from potential users.</li>
          <li>You cannot assume what the user knows and doesn't know. There were many times when I assumed a feature was intuitive, only to have it backfire on me when I realized users had no idea what a certain icon represented.</li>
          <li>The iterative process is real. I had to push past the mindset of completing a project and instead acknowledging that I'm doing my best work every iteration, even if that means the project is never complete.</li>
        </ol>
