      <h4><i>Competitive Analysis</i></h4>
      <p>In order to ensure that we met our goals for WCTD's website design, it was important to understand what factors go into redesigning an effective non-profit website. This website must effectivevly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raise awareness for a cause</li>
        <li>Provoke an emotional response from the visitor</li>
        <li>Inspire the visitor to take immediate action</li>
        <li>Accept donations through the website</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <p>We analyzed 2 non-profits - BuildOn and Malala Fund - to find out what strategies they used to create effective websites.</p>

          <li>Boldly indicate partnerships with multiple organizations in education, government, and technology.</li>

          <li>Includes a variety of research and data that shows the positive impact that her organization has created in the Middle East.</li>
          <li>Features partnerships with tech communities, most notably Bill & Melinda Gates' Foundation.</li>

      <h3>Empathize</h3>
      <h4><i>Surveys</i></h4>
      <p>We took the research phase further by surveying current users to discover their needs, wants, and pain points. Survey results revealed that the majority of users fell under 3 categories - <b>parents, students, and volunteers.</b> Their
        responses revealed that finding information was difficult, and that condensing the amount of sub-categories on the navigation bar and reducing the amount of text would improve the site's effectiveness.</p>

      <h4><i>User Personas</i></h4>
      <p>The results from the surveys revealed that 3 main user groups used WCTD - students, parents, and volunteers - so I created 3 personas to represent each respective group.</p>
      <p>Students are interested in advancing their skills, especially in STEM, but are typically unsure of where to look or how to get started. <b>They want to find an organization that contains a variety of programs where the information is
          easy to navigate through.</b></p>
      <p>Parents want to help their children achieve their education and career goals, but in order to do so, they need to know they're selecting the right program. <b>They want to find an organization that is respected as a resource in the
          community and offers a diverse range of programs.</b></p>
      <p>Volunteers want to give back to the community by getting involved with the organization of their choice. <b>To feel confident about their decision, they need to be able to quickly identify an alignment between the organization's mission
          and their own principles.</b></p>

      <h4><i>User Flows</i></h4>
      <p>Now that our primary users and their behaviors are identified, we could go ahead and create user flows to understand each respective user's process when navigating the website. I will be focusing on Katie's user flow. As a reminder,
        Katie is a parent and wants to find a program that will help her son's growing interest in STEM. She hopes to give her son exposure, education, and mentorship in STEM. The user flow portrays the steps that Katie will take to find a
        suitable STEM program for her son.</p>

      <h4><i>Sitemap</i></h4>
      <p>After identifying and consolidating our users' behaviors, goals, and pain points, it was time to create a sitemap to show the hierarchy of the redesigned website. With the sitemap, we hoped to achieve the following objectives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consolidate the amount of subcategories on the navigation bar</li>
        <li>Reduce the amount of information on each page</li>
        <li>Keep content consistent and organized</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We made the following changes to the sitemap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the news section, removed national impact and research. Currently we are using <b>Salesforce CRM to consolidate the research,</b> so that page will be unavailable for now. We discovered that <b>users were confused by what national
            impact</b> was supposed to be, that's removed as well.</li>
        <li>In the support us section, we created 4 sub-categories that are most important to getting people involved in our community.
      </ul>

      <h4><i>Wireframes</i></h4>
      <p>After the completion of the sitemap, we were ready to move onto wireframing.</p>
      <p>The wireframes below display the current state of the homepage and its first wireframe redesign. A few important points to call out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly emphasize WCTD's mission statement and impact through visuals and text</li>
        <li>Highlight upcoming events</li>
        <li>Highlight ways for volunteers to get involved</li>

        <p>I was responsible for creating the news wireframes. The current website doesn't feature a news overview page (for instance users could only click on a category of interest from the navigation bar). In the updated wireframe, I included an
          overview page, so users can scan through it first, and then click on anything of interest.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in viewing all the news wireframes, please click on the button below. There are 6 total wireframes that make up the news section.</p>
